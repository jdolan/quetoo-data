Quake Retexture Project
_______________________

Release: 7-22-06 (HAPPY 10th BITRHDAY, QUAKE!)
Files: 549 textures, 1 alternate, 1 readme
Size: 167 mb



FAQ:
	Q1) How do I install the pack?
	Q2) Why are only the textures and lumas present? what happened to gloss/bump/etc?
	Q3) Why are metal5_2, metal5_4, and metal5_8, and plat_top1 NOT released?
	Q4) Why are there two "Quake" textures?
	Q5) I think I can make a better texture than one from the pack. What do I do?
	Q6) I have a suggestion/complaint/request or want to help... how can I do so?
	Q7) Why are the textures now TGA instead of PNG?



	A1) Note that the best option is extracting this zip into id1 so _ALL_ engines (netquake, quakeworld, etc) will take advantage of them.

	Ezquake/Fuhquake/most engines (including FTE): Extract the zip into id1 (so id1\textures folder should be created).

	FTE: For easy-to-install for FTE, simply rename this file from qrp-textures-549files-7-22-06.zip to qrp-textures-549files-7-22-06.pk3 (note the extension change from .zip to .pk3). Then, put this file into your id1 directory. You're done.



	A2) There is a pack released with all textures (texture, luma, gloss, normal) for dm6 only. We are currently working on releasing normal/gloss maps in addition to the texture and luma but we have decided to work on non-advanced textures first and then release the normal/gloss textures. They will come. To download the dm6 pack with all textures, either go to the QRP website.



	A3) ID made a huge mistake in having DIFFERENT textures with the SAME name in different maps. For example, the metal5_2 in map A is different than the metal5_2 in map B (which caused old clients to crash). Anyway, if you'd like to help, bug coders (ezquake, fte, darkplaces, etc..) to come up with a solution. I've already presented a couple to them, so they should know what you're talking about.



	Q4) Moon[Drunk] did two "Quake" textures (first seen on start.bsp) - a faithful one and a faithful one with the words "Quake Retexture Project" written down the bottom. If you feel like supporting one of the most active and productive Quake projects, feel free to rename Quake-QRP.tga to Quake.tga and replace it with the one in /textures/ .



	A5) Contact me *BEFORE* you start making any textures. There are some things we need to review, and some simple guidelines.



	A6) For any questions, comments, suggestions, complaints, or if you want to get involved in the project, contact me via e-mail or irc.



	Q7) The Quake Retexture Project has for some time announced the move to TGA and from this point on (actually, from the dm6 releases on) all releases will be TGA. This is due to many reasons (file size, easier on the engine, etc.) that is explained in full on the webpage's FAQ.
