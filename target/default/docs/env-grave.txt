   directory and find the following 
   file :- SHADERLIST.TXT.
   
3. Open this file up in a text editor and add the
   following line at the bottom of the file.
   
   GRAVEYARD
   
4. Close the file and open Q3Radiant and you should
   find on the texture menu the GRAVEYARD subdirectory.
   
5. Choose the GRAVEYARD subdirectory and you should find
   the sky texture ready for use.
   
6. If the editor displays 2 textures use the one
   called GRAVE_SKYBOX. The other one is just so
   that you have something to remind you of what
   you are inserting into your map.
