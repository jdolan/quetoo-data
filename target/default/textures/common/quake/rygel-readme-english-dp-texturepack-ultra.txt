Installation:
-------------

-install Quake first :-)
-install Darkplaces
-install Darkplacesmod
-there you go to the dpmod/maps folder and delete the files b_exbox2.bsp and b_explob.bsp
-there you go to the dpmod/progs folder and delete the files v_dplight.mdl,v_dpnail.mdl,
v_dpnail2.mdl,v_dprock.mdl,v_dprock2.mdl,v_dpshot.mdl und v_dpshot2.mdl
-then you install the Texturepack, files allow to overwrite


If a new version of the Darkplacesmod comes out, 
-execute it only somewhere else there and names it around, for example, dpmod1
-then as on top described the files extinguish
-now you go to the dpmod/maps folder of Quake and copy b_batt0.bsp,b_batt1.bsp,b_bh10.bsp,
b_bh25.bsp,b_bh100.bsp,b_nail0.bsp,b_nail1.bsp,b_rock0.bsp,b_rock1.bsp,b_shell0.bsp and b_shell1.bsp
in dpmod1/maps folder,overwrite the files.
-then you go to the dpmod/progs folder of Quake and copy a_rock4.mdl,a_rock8.mdl,a_shell1.mdl and a_shell2.mdl 
in dpmod1/progs folder,overwrite the files.
-now you can rename dpmod1 in dpmod, then overwrite the dpmod in the Quake direcory,its ready.


Now you install the Texturepack 
-simply give the folder of Quake
 

The Texturemod requires 3.34 GB free space on your computer.


--------

The Texturepack is for highend PC´s and supports Offsetmapping, reliefmapping et cetera.
The textures are also effective in the resolution from 1920x1200 and higher very well, under it of course.
I have problems with the memory, there get I an error message. Because the textures are high dissolved becomes, 
the memory is Very full.
deswgen I had to put the Texturequality in Options "Change video mode" Texture Quality on "1", 
the textures do not look so great, but now the mistake of the memory does not come any more.
Sorry differently it does not go with me.
My system:
WinXP Pro-Sp2,2 Gig ram,Geforce 7600gs 256 MB ram

--------

You must put the highest quality of the textures with "Change video mode" Texture Quality on "0".

If I only recommended if her a very fast PC have with a lot of ram and graphic card with at least 512 mb of 
memory and more.

other console:
--------------
gl_picmip 0      0=best quality  1=a little worse quality

If you change it in the menu or in the console, you must restart Quake once more, or vid_restart give.

have in autoexec.cfg gl_picmip "1" stand

Texturepack
-----------
-all textures have been changed
-normalmaps with alpha channel,so have left out the bumpmaps
-menu with hud, conback et cetera
-sky box
-weapons
-ammo,boxes

Offestmapping
-------------
console:
r_glsl 1                                   off=0 on=1                 Aktivate the Opengl2.0 Pixel shader
r_glsl_offsetmapping 1                     off=0 on=1                 Aktivate Offsetmapping
r_glsl_offsetmapping_scale 0.05            0.00 to 0.16 or higher     how high the textures from stand (would not go only to 0.06 more)

offsetmapping is activated in autoexec.cfg 

skybox
------
console:
loadsky sky1
loadsky sky4

autoexec.cfg is present, there one loads sky1 with "F7" and sky4 with "F8"
